Datadog is the essential monitoring platform for cloud infrastructure, applications, and logs. We bring together data from servers, containers, databases, and third-party services to make your stack entirely observable. These capabilities help DevOps teams communicate, troubleshoot performance issues, and ensure customers are getting the best user experience with a single monitoring tool.

# How It Works:

This integration allows you to configure service hooks from Azure DevOps events. These are ingested into Datadog as new events that can be used for correlation, troubleshooting, and alerting. We also use them to create metrics in Datadog so you can track and alert on the number of different events types over time, as well as how long builds and work items take to complete.


Correlate your Azure DevOps events with monitoring data from the rest of your environment for improved visibility into how your developer operations are impacting application performance.

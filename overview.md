Datadog is the essential monitoring platform for cloud infrastructure, applications, and logs. We bring together data from servers, containers, databases, and third-party services to make your stack entirely observable. These capabilities help DevOps teams communicate, troubleshoot performance issues, and ensure customers are getting the best user experience with a single monitoring tool.
